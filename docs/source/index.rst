Caiman
======
Count Adjustment to Improve the Modeling of Gene Association Networks (Caiman) is a package aims at correcting the normalized expression for lowly expressed genes that increases false positive associations in co-expression analysis.

Introduction
------------
Caiman is a Python software pacakge developed by `Kuijjer's Lab <https://www.kuijjerlab.org/>`_ that specifically designed to correct the RNA-Seq expression normalized by quantile based normalization methods (e.g. `smooth quantile normalization <https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxx028>`_). Inspired by the concept proposed by `MIXnorm <https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/11/3401/5781955>`_, Caiman uses a modified Gaussian mixture model to fit the expression distribution of all samples within each group, and which then makes use of the posterior probability of the mixture model to identify those genes that might yield false-positive associations to other genes. 

Method
------
Caiman starts by logâ‚‚-transform the normalized expression to approximate Gaussian distribution. Thereafter, augment the processed expression by concatenating with the negative transformed expression. The augmented expression distribution is therefore symmetric with respect to 0. A Gaussian mixture model is later used with the center component fixed with mean equals to 0. The genes with high posterior probability from the center component are believed to be non-expressed in the cell. For those genes, Caiman replaces the normalized expression with zero to reduce the false discovery rate in identifying co-expressed genes.
